### **ðŸš— introducing the gas fund....**

hackathons are incredibly special. we ([Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)) want more people to be able to go to hackathons.

this year, we'll fund the cost of gas for you (or a parent) to drive to [any hackathon in the USA or Canada](https://hackathons.hackclub.com/). we'll alternatively reimburse you the equivalent of that if you buy a train or bus ticket.

#### are you international?
yay! we now welcome all our international hackers to get reimbursed for their travel to hackathons in their country.

do we support your country? find out [here](https://hackclub.notion.site/Where-can-you-Gas-Fund-15eb757f08a8809c88bee7bf632879b8)!

here's how it works:

1.  head on over to [the form](https://forms.hackclub.com/t/knkBupg1FNus) and upload your selfies, and projects!
2.  we'll reach out and, if you're good to go, we'll send a link for you to submit receipts!
3.  once we approve it, get your funds through direct deposit or cheque (US or Canada) or paypal outside of US/Canada

we're offsetting all related carbon emissions through funding a collection of Gold Standard-certified projects. **are you a hackathon organiser?** let's work together to get more people to your hackathon, reach out to [hackathons@hackclub.com](mailto:hackathons@hackclub.com).
